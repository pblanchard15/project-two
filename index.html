    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a student at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, IL.
        I am majoring in consumer research, which is essentially a mix of
        marketing and analytics. I am also apart of the basketball team at IIT
        and take great joy in the sport. I am originally from Chicago, IL but spent most of my childhood in
        Glenview which is just outside the city. Other than school and basketball,
        I spend most of my time going out to eat or wathing movies with my fmaily and friends.
